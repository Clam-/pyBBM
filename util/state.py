#preliminary State

# State class should only be used for reading by modules, and setting from main event triggers, I guess
# maybe this should be in a database, for things like "search all bans on Y channel from Z user"
#  LOL After toying with mockups of this idea no. If you want a ban DB it should be a module I guess...
